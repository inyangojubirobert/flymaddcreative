          <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">Purpose</h2>
          <p class="text-gray-600">To empower brands and creators with design and technology that amplify their voice in
            the digital world.</p>
          <p class="text-gray-600">At Flymadd Creative LLC, we bring ideas to life. From concept to interface, we help

          <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">Principles</h2>
          <ul class="list-disc pl-5 text-gray-600 space-y-1">
            <li>Human-centered creativity</li>
            <p class="text-gray-600">We design with empathy — focusing on real people, their goals, and the moments that
              matter most. Every experience should feel personal, intuitive, and meaningful.</p>
            <li>Consistency and craft</li>
            <p class="text-gray-600">Precision defines our process. We value detail, coherence, and discipline —
              ensuring every visual and interaction reflects the brand’s true essence.</p>
            <li>Measurable outcomes</li>
            <p class="text-gray-600"> Design is only powerful when it performs. We blend aesthetics with analytics to
              create work that inspires and delivers measurable results—tracking engagement, conversion, task
              completion, and long-term retention to ensure design drives real business value.</p>

          <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">Our Story</h2>
          <p class="text-gray-600">Flymadd Creative began with a simple belief — that creativity, when guided by purpose
            and precision, can transform how people experience technology.</p>

        <section class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow-md p-4">
          <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">Our Future</h2>
          <p class="text-gray-600">We don’t just design — we define how brands are seen, felt, and remembered.
            Our impact lives in every product, campaign, and experience that builds lasting trust between people and
            brands.</p>
          <p>What started as a passion for bold design and clean code evolved into a multidisciplinary studio that
            bridges art, usability, and innovation.</p>
